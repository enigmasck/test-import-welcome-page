Welcome to the Public Access Submission System (PASS) documentation! 

The Public Access Submission System (PASS) is an Eclipse open source platform designed to assist researchers, IT staff, compliance officers, and executives in efficiently and economically complying with the access policies of their funders and institutions.

Use Eclipse PASS to submit your manuscripts to funder and institutional publication repositories (e.g. PubMed Central, DSpace) and comply with access policies. Using the web-based PASS system, you can avoid paying article processing charges to make your publication open to the public, simultaneously send your manuscript to multiple repositories seamlessly, populate forms automatically with publication and author information by providing DOIs and ORCID IDs.
